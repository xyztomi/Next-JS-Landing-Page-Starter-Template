## What Is Local SEO?

Local SEO is the practice of optimizing your online presence to attract more business from relevant local searches. These searches take place on Google and other search engines, and they often include location-based terms like "near me" or a specific city name.

For small businesses that serve a local area, local SEO is arguably the most important type of SEO to invest in.

## Google Business Profile: Your #1 Priority

Your Google Business Profile (GBP) is the cornerstone of local SEO. It's the listing that appears in the map pack when someone searches for businesses like yours.

### Optimizing Your Google Business Profile

- **Complete every field** — Business name, address, phone, hours, categories, and description
- **Choose the right primary category** — This has the biggest impact on which searches you appear for
- **Add photos regularly** — Businesses with photos receive 42% more direction requests
- **Post updates weekly** — Google rewards active profiles with better visibility
- **Respond to every review** — Both positive and negative reviews deserve a response

## Local Citations and Directories

A citation is any online mention of your business name, address, and phone number (NAP). Consistent citations across the web tell Google that your business information is trustworthy.

### Top Directories for Small Businesses

1. Google Business Profile
2. Yelp
3. Facebook Business
4. Apple Maps
5. Bing Places
6. Industry-specific directories

**Consistency is key.** Your business name, address, and phone number must be identical across every listing.

## On-Page Local SEO

Your website also needs to be optimized for local search:

- **Include your city and state** in title tags, meta descriptions, and headings
- **Create location-specific pages** if you serve multiple areas
- **Embed a Google Map** on your contact page
- **Add LocalBusiness schema markup** to help search engines understand your business details

## Reviews: The Local SEO Superpower

Reviews are one of the strongest ranking factors for local search. They also heavily influence whether someone clicks on your listing.

### How to Get More Reviews

- Ask satisfied customers directly after completing a service
- Send follow-up emails with a direct link to your Google review page
- Make the process easy — the fewer clicks required, the better
- Never buy fake reviews or offer incentives, as this violates Google's policies

## Measuring Local SEO Success

Track these metrics to measure your local SEO progress:

- **Google Business Profile insights** — Views, searches, and actions
- **Local keyword rankings** — Track your position for "[service] + [city]" terms
- **Organic traffic from local searches** — Use Google Analytics to segment by location
- **Phone calls and form submissions** — The metrics that ultimately matter
