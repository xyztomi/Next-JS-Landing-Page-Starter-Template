## Introduction

Many small business owners know they need SEO but make critical mistakes that prevent them from ranking well in search results. Here are the 10 most common SEO mistakes we see — and how to fix them.

## 1. Not Having a Mobile-Friendly Website

Over 60% of searches now happen on mobile devices. If your website isn't mobile-friendly, Google will penalize your rankings.

**Fix:** Use responsive design that adapts to all screen sizes. Test your site with Google's Mobile-Friendly Test tool.

## 2. Ignoring Page Speed

Slow websites frustrate users and hurt rankings. Google uses Core Web Vitals as a ranking factor, and pages that load slowly will rank lower.

**Fix:** Compress images, enable browser caching, minimize JavaScript, and consider a Content Delivery Network (CDN).

## 3. Missing or Duplicate Title Tags

Every page on your website needs a unique, descriptive title tag that includes your target keyword. Many small business websites use the same title on every page or leave them blank.

**Fix:** Write unique title tags for every page, keeping them under 60 characters and including your primary keyword.

## 4. No Google Business Profile

If you serve local customers and don't have a claimed, optimized Google Business Profile, you're missing out on valuable local traffic.

**Fix:** Claim your profile at business.google.com and [follow our local SEO guide](/blog/local-seo-guide-small-business/) to optimize it.

## 5. Keyword Stuffing

Repeating the same keyword dozens of times on a page doesn't help your rankings — it hurts them. Google's algorithms are sophisticated enough to understand context and synonyms.

**Fix:** Write naturally for humans first. Use your primary keyword in the title, first paragraph, and a couple of headings, then use related terms throughout the content.

## 6. Neglecting Internal Linking

Internal links help Google understand your site structure and distribute page authority. Many small business websites have pages that are orphaned with no internal links pointing to them.

**Fix:** Link related pages together naturally within your content. Every page should be reachable within 3 clicks from the homepage.

## 7. Not Creating Fresh Content

A website that hasn't been updated in years sends a signal to Google that it may not be relevant. Regular content updates show that your business is active and your information is current.

**Fix:** Start a blog and publish at least one or two posts per month. Focus on answering questions your customers frequently ask.

## 8. Forgetting About Meta Descriptions

While meta descriptions aren't a direct ranking factor, they heavily influence click-through rates. A compelling meta description can be the difference between someone clicking your result or your competitor's.

**Fix:** Write unique, compelling meta descriptions for every page (under 160 characters) that include your keyword and a call to action.

## 9. Not Tracking Results

You can't improve what you don't measure. Many small businesses invest in SEO without tracking whether it's actually working.

**Fix:** Set up Google Analytics and Google Search Console (both free). Monitor organic traffic, keyword rankings, and conversions monthly.

## 10. Expecting Instant Results

SEO is a long-term strategy. Some businesses give up after a month or two because they don't see immediate results, missing out on the compounding benefits.

**Fix:** Commit to at least 6 months of consistent SEO effort. Track progress monthly and adjust strategies based on data.
